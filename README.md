Description:

This project was created for the purpose of passing the 'Semistructural databases' subject. It is a simple presentation of the capabilities of the MongoDB.


Note:

This app stores all data in Mongo database so, if you want to try it, you should:

1. Setup MongoDB server
2. Open Book Management System/MongoConnectionConfig.json file.
3. Set connection parameters of your MongoDB (host and port;     optionally login and password, if you set it).
4. Optionally: Set the names of database and collections used  by app. Don't worry, if you didn't create them yet; the app will create them automatically during initialization process.
